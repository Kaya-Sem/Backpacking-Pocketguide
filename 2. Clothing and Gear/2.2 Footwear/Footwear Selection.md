Choosing the right footwear is crucial for a comfortable and enjoyable hiking experience. Here, we'll explore the pros and cons of three popular options: hiking boots, hiking shoes, and trail runners.

### Hiking boots
*Pros:*
- **Protection:** Hiking boots offer superior protection against rocks, roots, and other hazards on the trail, reducing the risk of injuries.
- **Durability:** With their robust construction, hiking boots tend to be more durable and long-lasting than lighter footwear options.
- **Waterproofing:** Many hiking boots come with waterproof membranes, keeping your feet dry in wet conditions. (Check if you actually need that) #TODO
- **Stability:** Hiking boots provide a stable platform, which can be advantageous when carrying heavy loads or navigating challenging terrain. (Though this is disputed.)
*Cons:*
- **Weight:** Hiking boots are generally much heavier than hiking shoes and trail runners, which can lead to fatigue, especially on long hikes.
- **Breathability:** The thick, sturdy materials used in hiking boots may lead to less breathability, resulting in sweaty feet on hot days. This may cause trenchfoot or discomfort.

### Hiking shoes
*Pros:*
- **Lightweight:** Hiking shoes are lighter and more flexible than hiking boots, providing greater agility and less fatigue over long distances.
- **Versatility:** They offer a balance between protection and agility, making them suitable for a wide range of terrain.
- **Breathability:** Many hiking shoes feature mesh uppers that allow for excellent airflow, keeping your feet cool and dry.

*Cons:*
- **Support:** Hiking shoes typically offer less support compared to hiking boots, which may not be suitable for rough or uneven terrain.
- **Limited Waterproofing:** While some hiking shoes come with waterproofing, they may not offer the same level of protection as hiking boots in wet conditions.

In practice, these are not the most popular option, because it is sort of a jack-of-all-traits, not really offering real benefits above trailrunners or boots. If You dislike hiking boots, try trailrunners first.


### Trailrunners
*Pros:*
- **Agility and Speed:** Trail runners are designed for speed and agility, allowing for quick and **efficient** movement over varied terrain. You feet will be less tired at the end of the day.
- **Comfort:** They often feature cushioning and flexible materials that provide comfort.
- **Breathability:** Trail runners typically have breathable mesh uppers that help to keep your feet cool and dry.

*Cons:*
- **Protection:** They provide less protection against rocks, roots, and other trail hazards compared to hiking boots and even hiking shoes.
- **Durability:** Trail runners are not nearly as durable as hiking boots or hiking shoes, especially in rough terrain or when carrying heavy loads. Most last only between 500-1200km, whereas boots and shoes last for years, and can ofted be resoled.
