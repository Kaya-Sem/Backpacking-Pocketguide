### Why should I clean my shoes?
Your footwear is built to withstand a lot, like exploring muddy, gritty trails, but that doesn't mean it's a great idea to toss them in the closet and forget about them after a trip. Clean them faithfully and you'll enjoy many years on the trail together and reduce the need to replace them prematurely. 

- When your boots or trailrunners flex, dirt, grit and sand creep deeper into their leather or fabric, grinding away like sandpaper.
- Mud sucks moisture from leather as it dries, leaving your boots's leather less pliable and speeding up its aging process.

### What you'll need for cleaning your *hiking boots*

- A boot-specific brush, an old vegetable brush or toothbrush
- Specialized boot cleaner, saddle soap or a mild solution of dish-washing soap and water

### Cleaning the Uppers

ⓘ Removes laces prior to cleaning


To clean, wash with cold water and a soft brush and **dry away from sources of direct heat**. Use a protective spray to make hide and fabrics water repellent and nourishing revitalizing cream or wax for natural leathers.
Store in a dry, dark place with no drastic temperature fluctuations. 

	ⓘ Avoid hitting your boots together to shake of debris. This causes small cracks in the rubber where bacteria like to fester, causing accelerated decay

### Trailrunners
Cleaning these versatile shoes is relatively straightforward compared to leather boots and other footwear types.

A simple and effective method for cleaning trailrunners involves using soap and warm water.  You can either use a soft-bristled brush or simply use your hands to gently scrub the shoes, paying extra attention to areas where dirt tends to accumulate.

The synthetic materials used in trail runners are generally more forgiving than natural materials like leather, so you don't need to worry about special treatments or products. After cleaning, rinse the shoes thoroughly with clean water to remove any soap residue.
