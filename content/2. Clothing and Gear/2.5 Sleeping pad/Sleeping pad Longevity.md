### Tips to Protect your Mattress

- Partially deflate your mattress when leaving it inflated during the day, especially in your tent or car on a hot day. Barometric pressure and significant changes in temperature and weather will affect your matresses' inflation and possibly damage it
- Never set up your mattress on rocks or sharp surfaces
- Use a ground cloth beneath the the mattress if you aren't sleeping in a tent.
- Do not use your mattress as a flotation device
- Do not expose mattress to flame or sparks
- Do not pressurize mattress with high-pressure pumps (over 1psi)
- Do not contaminate the mattress with Deet-based insect-repellants, sunscreen, or chlorine.
- Do not expose mattress to long periods of direct sunlight. Ultraviolet rays gradually destroy the coated fabric.
- Always cary the mattress in a stuffsack or other protective bag
- Keep mattresses away from your pets. Dogs love to chew the valves, and cats like to sharpen their claws on the mattress.
