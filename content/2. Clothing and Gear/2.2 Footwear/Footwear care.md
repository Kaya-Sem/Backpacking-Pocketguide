### Why should I clean my shoes?
Your footwear is built to explore muddy, gritty trails, but that doesn't mean it's a great idea to toss them in the closet and forget about them. Clean them faithfully and you'll enjoy many years on the trail together and reduce the need to replace them prematurely. If you're too tired immediately after a hike, then clean them the following day. 

- When your boots flex, dirt, grit or sand creep deeper into their leather and fabric, grinding away like sandpaper.
- Mud sucks moisture from leather as it dries, leaving your boots's leather less pliable and speeding up its aging process.

### What you'll need for cleaning your hiking boots

- A boot-specific brush, an old vegetable brush or toothbrush
- Specialized boot cleaner, saddle soap or a mild solution of dishwashing soap and water

### Cleaning the Uppers

ⓘ Removes laces prior to cleaning


To clean, wash with cold water and a soft brush and **dry away from sources of direct heat**. Use a protective spray to make hide and fabrics water repellent and nourishing revitalizing cream or wax for natural leathers.
Store carefully in a dry, dark place where there are no sudden changes in temperature. 

	ⓘ Avoid hitting your boots together to shake of debris. This causes small cracks in the rubber where bacteria like to fester, causing accelerated decay
