1. **Google Forms or Typeform:** Create a simple form using Google Forms or Typeform where users can input their suggestions. You can include fields for the specific page or topic they are suggesting changes for, and a text box for their proposed changes. You can then manually review the suggestions and apply them to your Obsidian knowledge base.
    
2. **Email Submission:** Allow users to send their suggestions via email. Set up a dedicated email address for this purpose and include instructions on your Obsidian Publish site for users to send their suggestions. You can then review the emails and implement the changes as needed.
    
3. **Discord or Slack Community:** If you have a community around your knowledge base, consider setting up a Discord or Slack server. Create a dedicated channel where users can submit their suggestions. This allows for real-time communication and discussion, which can help clarify suggestions before implementing them.
    
4. **Web-based Commenting System:** Integrate a third-party web-based commenting system, such as Disqus, into your Obsidian Publish site. This would allow users to leave comments on your pages, effectively suggesting changes. You can then review these comments and update your content accordingly.
    
5. **Custom Web Form:** Create a custom web form on your Obsidian Publish site using HTML and JavaScript. Users can input their suggestions, and the form can then process and store the suggestions. This approach requires some web development skills.
    
6. **Third-Party Collaboration Tools:** Utilize collaboration tools like Trello or Notion to collect and manage user suggestions. You can create a board or database where users submit their suggestions, and then you can review, categorize, and implement them.
    
7. **Link to GitHub Issues:** Even though you mentioned that many users may not be familiar with GitHub, you can still provide a simplified way for them to suggest changes. Create a page on your Obsidian site with clear instructions on how to submit suggestions using GitHub's issue system. Include step-by-step screenshots or videos to guide users through the process.
    

Remember to clearly communicate to your users how they can provide feedback and suggestions, and make the process as straightforward as possible. Choose an approach that aligns with the technical expertise of your audience and your own management preferences.
